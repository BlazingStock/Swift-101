// “trigger an assertion in your code to end code execution and to provide an opportunity to debug the cause of the absent or invalid value.”

// “You use an assertion to make sure that an essential condition is satisfied before executing any further code. ”        “If the condition evaluates to true, code execution continues as usual; if the condition evaluates to false, code execution ends, and your app is terminated.”
